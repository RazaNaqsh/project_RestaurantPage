# Project Restaurant

This is my first project using webpack. The module bundler thing is amazing! It
felt so awesome to write Js in different modules and get the things so neatly.

## What I learnt :

Setting up and configuring Webpack from scratch

Adding assets and loaders in webpack

Creating everything using JS(didnt use any single html element in this project
except one empty divcontainer)

Module approach of writing JS (single component for single task)
